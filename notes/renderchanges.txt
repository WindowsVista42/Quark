augmenting the rendering pipeline and creating a whole ass vulkan abstraction will NOT be a thing

instead
you can add new materials
you can add new post processing effects

-- THATS IT --

materials have instance data and global data
post process effects have global data

effects should not be bound to a mesh pool, you should just be able to select a mesh pool when binding an effect
and also, have the option to switch mesh pool when drawing

struct MaterialEffectInfo {
  u32 material_id;
  u32 vertex_shader_id;
  u32 fragment_shader_id;
    
  FillMode fill_mode;
  CullMode cull_mode;
  BlendMode blend_mode;
};

then you can just add the instances to the corresponding draw batch
and updating the global material info is as easy as updating the global resource

struct PostProcessEffect {
  u32 post_process_id;
  u32 fragment_shader_id;
};
