augmenting the rendering pipeline and creating a whole ass vulkan abstraction will NOT be a thing

instead
you can add new materials
you can add new post processing effects

-- THATS IT --

materials have instance data and global data
post process effects have global data

effects should not be bound to a mesh pool, you should just be able to select a mesh pool when binding an effect
and also, have the option to switch mesh pool when drawing
