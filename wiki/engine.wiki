* [.] Renderer 3
    * [.] Data Layout
        * [X] Use one big vertex buffer for all vertex information
        * [ ] Make writing to the vertex buffer atomic
        * [ ] Use array textures to store texture information
        * [ ] Make writing to the array texture atomic

    * [ ] Compute Shaders
        * [ ] Use indirect drawing
        * [ ] Use a compute shader to calculate world matrix data
        * [ ] Use a compute shader to calculate gpu LOD information
        * [ ] Use a compute shader to compute frustum culling

    * [ ] Architecture
        * [ ] Use global batches based on render pipeline
        * [ ] Find an efficient way to store and combine all of these in one uber-shader for lighting
        * [ ] Texture mip-mapping
        * [ ] Efficiently support 20k draw calls
        * [ ] 3D skeletal animation / 3D stop motion animation
        * [ ] Anisotropic filtering

    * [ ] Lighting
        * [ ] Deferred Lighting
