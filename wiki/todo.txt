Sean:
    X Entity Hierarchies
    X Player physics based movement and toggleable flycam
    X Add raycast shooting and some kind of entity reaction
      X Test by deleting entities, and maybe recursively delete if they have children?
    X Expand physics based movement, dashes, ground detection, animated actions
      X Steal code from previous projects, ie. LW
      X Migrate movement to force application only instead of manually setting velocity
      X Physics movement thats smooth
      X Dashes
      X Ground detection using raycasting
      X Ground detection using shapecasting 
    - Commit war crimes in lithuania
    - Play around with fast dashes damaging enemies
    - More advanced movement?
      - Wall jump
      - Mantle
      - Other things?
    - Mess around with enemy ai
      - Enemies shooting at player
      - Enemies responding to player shots
      - Enemies moving
        - Enemies pathfinding
      - Enemy state machine
    - Mess around with rudamentary animation system
      - This would require me to make assets :|
    - Update quark headers for better consistency (lib\Quark\src\quark2headers)
	X Shadows
    X Rendered shadow map
    - Render shadow map from orthographic top-down view
      X Rendered from low fov perspective top-down view
	  X Sampled shadow map
	  X Move shadow map to be from the suns position
	  - Cascaded shadow mapping (or some other fancy solution)
      - 2DSkewedShadows
        - Perspective Shadow Map
  X Migrate renderer to headers 2.0

  - Future Lighting Stuff
    - Ambient directional light type
      Lights that add ambient lighting to the scene (could just be attenuation)
